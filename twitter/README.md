SwiftCore Twitter Streaming
===========================
Gets content from Twitter, using track and filter predicates, via the streaming API.

__NOTE__: Tweepy doesn't handle UTF-8 predicates very well and this causes a `UnicodeEncodeError` 
exception to be thrown. You'll therefore need to apply this patch - https://github.com/tweepy/tweepy/pull/142 - to `streaming.py`
Alternatively, you can grab a copy of `streaming.py` that already includes this patch from https://gist.github.com/165ff4cb6664dcc5942c
